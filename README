General Information
===================

PyCo is a content management system for small and almost static web pages.

The PyCo CMS consists of three parts which will build the final web page:
  * The pages structure
  * The page content
  * The template

The page structure is a simple folder structure containing files for pages.
Every element on the folder structure, whether file, folder or link, will be a
page on the final web page. A regular file defines the page using the file name
as page title and the file content as page content. A directory must contain a
file or link with the name '.content' which specifies the page created for the
folder. A link could link to another file, link or folder to make the page(s)
available on the position of the link. The order of the pages is defined by an
extended file attribute configurabel in the PyCo settings. The order attribute
is optional and stored for each file  used to sort the pages in a directory.

The page content is written in HTML. The content will be inserted into the
template without modification. To pass the content to a specific module the
content can be preceded with a shi-bang style declaration. The shi-bang
declaration looks like the following: '#! MODULE'. The declaration must existst
in the first line without any preceeding spaces. The 'MODULE' must be replaced
with the name of the mudule to pass the raw content throught. The description
of the renderers are located in the renderers code: /renderers/MODULE.

The template creates from the current context and the rendered content a
web page. The template will be loaded and populated with HTML created from the
page content and serveral other values from the current context. The rendered
template provides the final web page. The template system used is jinja2
which allows to write complex expressions inside of the template and is able to
process all the information provided by PyCo to build high quality web pages.
For further information about jinja2 see <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/>.
