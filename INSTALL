Software requirements
=====================

To run PyCo you need a running web server as Apache or LightTPD and a python
interpreter.

The following python modules are also required:
  - creoleparser
  - jinja2
	- xattr

To install the python modules on debian based linux systems you could run the
following command:
  apt-get install python-creoleparser python-jinja2 python-xattr

Extended file attributes must be enabled, because of the ordering informations
stored as xattr entry. I know, it currently collides with SELinux. If you have
any better idea where to store the ordering information, please tell me...


Web server requirements
=======================

This installation method requires that running of CGI scripts is allowed from
everywhere in the document root of your web server. It might be insecure and
other methods will be available, but I have never tested them.

The python interpreter must be configured as CGI script handler.


Installation
============

Copy the file 'index.py' to the document root of your web server and create the
folders 'template' and 'pages'.

Its highly recommended that the special page '404' exits in the pages root. To
create it create the file 'pages/404' and fill it with some nifty
page-not-found message.

Now you can create the pages and the template. See the file 'README'.
