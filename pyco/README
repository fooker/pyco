General Information
===================

PyCo is a content management system for small and almost static web pages.

The PyCo CMS consists of three parts which will build the final web page:
  * The pages structure
  * The page content
  * The template

The page structure is a simple folder structure containing files for pages.
Every element on the folder structure, whether file, folder or link, will be a
page on the final web page. A regular file defines the page using the file name
as page title and the file content as page content. A directory must contain a
file or link with the name '.content' which specifies the page created for the
folder. A link could link to another file, link or folder to make the page(s)
available on the position of the link.

The page content is written using creole syntax. the creole syntax is the
commonly known as wiki-syntax. This allows to write and edit page content using
every text editor in an easy to learn syntax. For further information about
creole see <http://www.wikicreole.org/>.

The template creates from the current context and the parsed creole content a
web page. The template will be loaded and populated with HTML created from the
page content and serveral other values from the current context. The rendered
template provides the final web page. The template system used is jinja2
which allows to write complex expressions inside of the template and is able to
process all the information provided by PyCo to build high quality web pages.
For further information about jinja2 see <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/>.
