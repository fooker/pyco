The creole renderer is a simple [[Projects/PyCo/Renderers | PyCo renderer]] which allows to build content pages in an easy markup language.

The shebang of the creole renderer is //creole//.

== Syntax ==
The [[http://www.wikicreole.org | creole syntax]] is a unified markup language for wiki markup. For an overview of elements and its syntax check out the creole wiki:

== Links ==
As in almost every wiki, it is possible to define links in PyCo. A local link can refer to a PyCo site using the same path as in the filesystem tree.

The following example will create a link to the site ''/Projects/PyCo/Renderers/Creole'' with the caption ''Creole Renderer'':

{{{
#! creole
