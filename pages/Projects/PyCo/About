For building homepages CMSs are one of the best ways. It allows you to seperate the content from the design. The content can be organized by articles, categories and tags.
But most pages, are smal pages to provide specific information for a single project / person. These pages are commonly managed by a single administrator.
For those pages there is no need for a user management with serveral roles, a big database, and a plugin system and you need a lot of time to learn handling of such a CMS.


The PyCo project is developed from an idea during the easter holidays to avoid the problems above.
It combinates a filesystem sub-tree, a markup language and a template engine to make it possible to build static homepages in a fast way.

This allows to build a home page very fast. You can build the page template and can start to create articles by creating files.

I have held an talk about PyCo on the [[http://nop.hs-fulda.org | Night of Projects]] (German). Recordings of the talk are available [[http://nop.hs-fulda.org/index.py/Fahrplan | here]].


== Why use PyCo ==
PyCo is a page management system which allows to create a static home page in a fast and easy way without a web driven admin interface and other junk.


== Technical overview ==
PyCo is a fast CGI module written in python. It conists of three parts:

**Filesystem Tree:**
The filesystem tree represents the article layout of the page. The file system tree is directly transformed into the page tree.

**Renderers:**
To design the content pages PyCo uses a [[Projects/PyCo/Renderers | renderers]]. The renderers are snippets of code rendering the content file to some sort of HTML output. There is a growing list of these renderers.

**Template Engine:**
To create the fully blown home page from the content PyCo uses the [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/|Jinja]] template engine to create the HTML output.


== Download ==
//PyCo is just a script hacked in a short time. It is **currently in a beta state**. It will work in most cases - but future versions maybe break the API.//

Currently there is no download archive available. But the latest version can be received by git:
[[https://github.com/fooker/pyco]]


== Licence ==
PyCo is open source and licenced under the GPL 3. You can read and download the licence under [[http://gplv3.fsf.org/]].
