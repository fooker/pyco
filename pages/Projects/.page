Here you will find a list of projects I am currently working on or I have worked on.

Most of the projects are Free or Open Source Software projects but some projects will include hardware too. The projects are almost based on free or open source software and are developed using GNU/Linux systems ([[http://gentoo.org | gentoo]] in most cases).

Feel free to look around and use or play with the projects. Comments, remarks and patches are welcome.

If you have questions, comments and bug-reports, feel free to contact me by mail( [[mailto:fooker@lab.sh | fooker@lab.sh]] ).
