It's very common for shell tools to print out file names followed by a line number seperated by a colon. A common example is the //gcc// error message:

{{{
fooker@R4-G9 tmp % gcc -c test.c\ntest.c: In function "main":
test.c:176: error: "baz" undeclared (first use in this function)
test.c:176: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
test.c:176: error: for each function it appears in.)
}}}

As you can see, the error is in file //test.c// on line 176.

As far as I know, no known editor supports this format for opening files and jump to the given line directly. Therefore I have written a little script which splits up the given arguments and calls //vim// with the given filename and let it jump to the given line number.
